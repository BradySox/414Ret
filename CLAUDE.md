# 414Ret — Claude Code Guide

The **414th Joint Fighter Group's fork of DCS Retribution** — a turn-based dynamic
campaign generator for DCS World, plus the 414th's air-defense, electronic-warfare,
recon, frontline, and assets-pack features on top of upstream.

- Base: upstream `dcs-retribution/dcs-retribution` `dev` @ `dce851ea`.
- GitHub (this fork): https://github.com/bradyccox/414Ret
- Read this before touching anything. The human-friendly overview is [`README.md`](README.md).

## Session Startup & Documentation Hygiene

**GitHub:** https://github.com/bradyccox/414Ret

**At the start of every new thread**, sync with GitHub before touching any code or docs:

```powershell
git fetch origin
git pull
git log origin/main -5 --oneline   # scan for new commits since last session
```

If the current branch is behind `main`, merge or rebase before editing anything — a branch
cut from a stale base produces exactly the duplicate-work + conflict mess that sinks a PR.
Never derive the state of the codebase from memory; always read the current files.

**Keeping docs in sync** — when a feature lands or changes, update in this order:

1. Relevant `docs/dev/design/` file — design rationale and technical details
2. Matching section in `docs/dev/414th-features.md` — engineering deep-dive, file paths, gotchas
3. `README.md` — if the change is player-visible
4. `CLAUDE.md` / `docs/dev/CLAUDE-architecture.md` — if the tech stack, architecture patterns, or feature list changed
5. `AGENTS.md` — sync to mirror `CLAUDE.md` (see Conventions)
6. `docs/dev/414th-ingame-pass-checklist.md` — add a row for any feature with runtime behavior that CI can't exercise

A push that moves code past its docs is a broken push.

## Project Docs

The per-feature engineering internals and design rationale live in `docs/`, not in this
file. This guide is the map; those are the territory.

- [docs/dev/414th-features.md](docs/dev/414th-features.md) — **the deep dive**: every 414th
  feature with file paths, gotchas, tests, and deferred work. Read the relevant section
  before editing a feature.
- [docs/dev/414th-ingame-pass-checklist.md](docs/dev/414th-ingame-pass-checklist.md) — the
  **in-game pass tracker**: every "needs an in-game pass" item with an observable pass
  criterion + the fail signature to watch for. Update status when you fly it; clear the tag
  in `414th-features.md` when it reaches VERIFIED.
- [docs/dev/414th-upstreaming-inventory.md](docs/dev/414th-upstreaming-inventory.md) — the
  **upstreaming queue**: which generic fixes to carve toward `bradyccox/dcs-retribution`
  (priority-ordered, with readiness marks) and which fork-specific bits must NEVER go upstream.
- [docs/dev/design/](docs/dev/design/) — per-feature design notes (read before touching the
  matching code):
  - `414th-air-defense-planning-notes.md` — CAP/BARCAP/QRA planning intent
  - `414th-tic-dynamic-fronts-notes.md` — TIC stance/cadence movement design
  - `414th-tars-recon-notes.md` — TARS recon engine
  - `414th-flightcontrol-notes.md` — Flight Control ATC
  - `414th-dtc-export-notes.md` — DTC cartridge format + reverse-engineered schema
  - `414th-scar-task-spec.md` + `414th-scar-commander-sme-questions.md` — SCAR ground truth
  - `414th-scar-phase2-sof-plan.md` + `414th-scar-HANDOFF.md` — SCAR commander-capture plan + next-session pickup
  - `414th-aircraft-task-rebalance-rubric.md` — aircraft task-priority rebalance rubric
  - `414th-red-tide-campaign-notes.md` — Red Tide campaign laydown + `.miz`/faction edits
  - `414th-red-tide-supply-routes-notes.md` — YAML supply routes + Kastrup preset patch
- [README.upstream.md](README.upstream.md) — unmodified upstream project README (setup,
  dependencies, wiki links).
- `AGENTS.md` mirrors this file — see **Conventions** below for the sync process.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Campaign engine | Python 3.11 (`game/`) |
| UI | PyQt (`qt_ui/`) + React/Leaflet client (`client/`) — client NOT type-checked in CI |
| Mission scripting | **Lua 5.1** sandbox plugins (`resources/plugins/`) — no `os`/`io`, no `goto`, definition order matters |
| In-mission framework | MOOSE (bundled `Moose.lua`; some plugins vendor classes verbatim) |
| Units / mission format | pydcs; CurrentHill mod packs in `pydcs_extensions/` |
| CI gates | Black + mypy + pytest + **Lua syntax gate** (`lua-lint.yml`, blocking) + advisory luacheck |
| Release | PyInstaller → rolling `latest` pre-release on GitHub |

## Repo & Branch Layout

- This repo (`bradyccox/414Ret`) `main` = the consolidated, most-up-to-date 414th build.
- Upstream is `dcs-retribution/dcs-retribution`; the 414th's PR fork is
  `bradyccox/dcs-retribution`. Open upstream PRs carved out of this work:
  - **#784** `codex/currenthill-iran-pack` — the Iran pack (branch also carries the full
    feature stack).
  - **#786** `codex/fix-aaq33-era-restriction` — targeting-pod era-restriction fix (separate,
    small; NOT part of the feature stack on `main`).
- The 414th's primary "all features" working branch in the dev checkout is
  `414th-all-features`; `main` here = that + the Iran pack + a Black/mypy lint pass.

## PINNED — do not modify

**`latest` git tag** — owned by `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` inside `414th-latest.yml`.
Do NOT delete it or manually push it — breaking it breaks the URL the squadron bookmarks.

**`414th-latest.yml`** — the sole rolling-release mechanism. Do NOT modify it without
understanding the impact. Test in a branch and verify the `latest` release after merging.
Do NOT add Discord webhook or other org-level secrets — the workflow uses only `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

**Local Python runtime** — before deleting anything under `tmp/`, inspect `.venv/pyvenv.cfg`.
The current Windows virtual environment may have
`home = ...\tmp\uv-python\cpython-3.11.15-windows-x86_64-none`; when it does,
that `tmp/uv-python` directory is the base interpreter for `.venv`, **not a disposable
cache**. Deleting it breaks `run_retribution.bat` with "No Python at ...". Either preserve
the directory or rebuild `.venv` against a permanent Python 3.11 installation first.
Cleanup scripts and agents must never recursively delete `tmp/` without this check.

**`resources/plugins/splashdamage3/Splash_Damage_3.4.2_414th.lua`** — the 414th's
buddy-tuned Splash Damage build (`overall_scaling=0.6`, `rocket_multiplier=0.8`,
`static_damage_boost=1`, shaped-charge rocket flags, `game_messages=true`). Do NOT overwrite
it from upstream. Settings are LOCKED by design: `plugin.json` has no `specificOptions` and
`sd3-config.lua` was removed. Don't reintroduce the config layer.

## Conventions

- Match the surrounding code's style; run the three validation commands (in `CLAUDE-ci.md`) before pushing.
- Keep the doc faces in sync: when a feature lands or changes, update **both**
  [`README.md`](README.md) (player-facing) and the relevant section of
  [docs/dev/414th-features.md](docs/dev/414th-features.md) (engineering), plus this map if the
  shape changed. A push that moves the code past its docs is a broken push.
- Keep player-facing plugin behavior and any overview docs in sync with code changes.
- **AGENTS.md sync** — `AGENTS.md` is a byte-identical mirror of this file (CLAUDE.md is
  authoritative; only line 1, the title, differs). After editing CLAUDE.md or any `@`-imported
  file, resync it: `cp CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md` then Edit line 1 back to `# AGENTS.md ...`
  (do NOT use `sed -i`; it flattens CRLF). The imported files (`docs/dev/CLAUDE-architecture.md`,
  `docs/dev/CLAUDE-ci.md`) are shared — both CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md reference the same files.
