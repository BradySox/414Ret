## Key Architecture Patterns

**Planner / Lua split.** Python plans and spawns the mission (flight plans, ROE, templates);
runtime behavior (EW, ISR, recon scoring, frontline firefights, ATC) is driven by the Lua
plugins. When a feature has both, the Python side sets up and the Lua side executes — don't
move runtime logic into the planner or vice versa.

**Plugin script injection (the uniform late-init pass).** Most 414th plugins are normal
work-order plugins. TIC, TARS, and SCAR additionally need their main script loaded **after**
every plugin's config table exists (their init reads `dcsRetribution.plugins.<name>` / MOOSE
at file scope) — an ordering the per-plugin work-order pass can't express. They are `LuaPlugin`
subclasses (`game/plugins/{tic,tars,scar}.py`, registered in `manager.py`'s `_PLUGIN_CLASSES`)
declaring `late_init_files()` / `late_init_preamble()` / `should_late_init()`; `inject_plugins()`
runs a **second pass** that calls `inject_late_init()` on each after the normal config pass. A
missing/renamed init file is now caught by a test (`game/plugins/tests/test_late_init.py`)
instead of the feature silently never starting. (Replaces the old hand-injected
`_inject_*_script()` "scramble pattern".)

**Viewer-aware visibility layer (recon fog).** One layer drives two player-facing fog rules.
AI planning and threat math always use ground truth (`viewer=None`); only the human (BLUE)
map/UI are fogged. `TheaterUnit.alive_for(viewer)` handles BDA damage lag;
`TheaterGroundObject.known_for(viewer)` handles recon intel-fog; `hidden_on_player_map(viewer)`
fully hides enemy command posts for the SCAR commander-capture feature (gated by
`scar_command_post_intel`, now default ON for new campaigns; §15). Every
accessor takes `viewer: Optional[Player] = None` defaulting to truth; consumers gate at the edge.
Do **not** reintroduce the old `_for_player`/`_for` method twins — that collapse is finished.
A runtime **overview toggle** (`game/theater/fogofwar.py`, transient/never-pickled) short-circuits
those three fog leaves (`alive_for`, `known_for`, `hidden_on_player_map`) to ground truth for any
viewer, so the *whole* render path + intel dialogs un-fog with **no** server-model changes. It is
a checkbox in the custom map layers panel (`MapLayersControl`, §19), driven by a state
`useEffect` (not a Leaflet add/remove layer — unmount doesn't reliably fire `remove`) that
`PUT`s `/fog-of-war/reveal` then re-pulls `/game`.
(`game/theater/theatergroup.py`, `theatergroundobject.py`; see features doc §3.)

**Save migration.** Removed/renamed enums migrate old pickles in `FlightType._missing_`
(runtime) and `persistency.py` `_handle_flight_type` (unpickler); fog state migrates in
`__setstate__`. When you remove or rename a persisted field, add the migration in both
places so existing campaigns don't brick.

**Lua plugin discipline.** Lua 5.1 only, vanilla DCS units only (no HighDigitSAMs etc.),
define functions before first use. The `lua-lint.yml` CI workflow runs `luac5.1 -p` over
every `resources/plugins/**/*.lua` as a blocking syntax gate — a plugin that fails to parse
would die silently in-mission, so this catches it before merge.

## Features at a Glance

Full internals for each are in [docs/dev/414th-features.md](docs/dev/414th-features.md)
(section numbers below).

1. **QRA intercept reserve** — per-squadron alert reserve feeding the upstream PR #782 Moose
   `AI_A2A_DISPATCHER`. Base-defense posture by default. (Old ramp-scramble is retired.)
2. **JAMMING flight type** — C-130J as EC-130H/RC-130H EW+ISR platform (`c130j` plugin);
   the old generic `ewrj` fighter-pod jammer is retired and must not be restored.
3. **TARPS recon + BDA fog-of-war** — player F-14 photo recon; viewer-aware fog (damage lag +
   recon intel-fog) makes recon worth flying.
4. **UI transparency** — Target Intel panel, Mission Impact debrief summary, package context
   bar, flight-creation context, building-card cleanup.
5. **Player target location precision** — `Approximate` mode offsets steerpoints + hides exact
   marks/coords so players must visually acquire.
6. **Air-defense planning rework** — overlapping/jittered BARCAP waves, forward CAP line,
   threat-weighted BARCAP volume, front-line navmesh routing hazard, unstacked FLOT units.
7. **Auto-hide mobile SAMs on MFD** — SHORAD/AAA/MANPAD hidden from datalink, including
   escorts inside armor/missile groups; standalone MERAD/LORAD stay visible for SEAD.
8. **Robustness / crash fixes** — flight-exit IndexError, AWACS/tanker orbit, malformed mod
   payload Lua.
9. **TIC — Troops In Contact** — scripted frontline firefights with per-stance movement +
   414th ambient-fire extension (plugin, default ON).
10. **CurrentHill Iran assets pack** — Shahed-136, IRGCN FAC, `[CH] Iran 2020` faction.
11. **Native DCS DTC cartridge export** — RETIRED (2026-06-26): half-baked; removed.
12. **TARS recon engine** — MOOSE Ops.TARS runtime for TARPS, feeds confirmed BDA (default ON).
13. **Flight Control ATC** — RETIRED (2026-06-26): half-baked; removed.
14. **Plugin Options UI** — `descriptionInUI` field + label/default polish across all plugins.
15. **SCAR** — player-flown Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance against a moving HVT
    (flight type + scenario `scar` plugin, default ON), plus a commander-capture path using
    finite purchased SOF inventory + a downed-team CSAR recovery loop (gated by
    `scar_command_post_intel`, now default ON for new campaigns while it is playtested).
16. **Settings QOL audit** — dead/duplicate setting cleanup (four fields removed), AI-radio
    booleans consolidated into the `AiRadioBehavior` enum with deterministic save migration,
    plugin wording, and a UI-layer grouping/dependency handoff
    ([docs/dev/settings-qol-audit.md](docs/dev/settings-qol-audit.md)).
17. **Auto-planner target unpredictability** — opt-in, per-side
    (`ownfor_/opfor_planner_unpredictability`, default 0) weighted-random reordering of the
    HTN's *opportunistic* offensive targets (strike/OCA/BAI/anti-ship/non-threatening DEAD)
    so red stops hitting the same things every turn; reactive threat response stays strictly
    deterministic. The low-risk in-Python alternative to a runtime MOOSE `Ops.Chief` red
    rewrite (`game/commander/tasks/targetorder.py`; features doc §17).
18. **Fog-of-war overview toggle** — transient "Reveal fog of war" checkbox in the unified
    map layers panel (§19, "Enemy intel" group) that short-circuits the three recon-fog
    leaves to ground truth, un-fogging the whole map + intel dialogs (enemy composition, threat
    rings, hidden command posts) with no server-model changes. `PUT /fog-of-war/reveal` flips the
    flag, then the client re-pulls `/game`. Never persisted; defaults off
    (`game/theater/fogofwar.py`, `game/server/fogofwar/`; features doc §3).
19. **Unified map layers panel** — one custom, dark-themed Leaflet control
    (`client/src/components/maplayers/MapLayersControl.tsx`) replacing both stock layer controls:
    collapsible grouped sections (advanced groups start collapsed), preset views (Default / SEAD /
    Recon / Clean), and `localStorage`-persisted choices (except the transient fog overview). The
    old top-left threat-zone/navmesh/terrain control is folded in; side-effect toggles run via
    `useEffect`, not Leaflet add/remove. Client-only; needs the CI client rebuild (features doc §18 / §19).
