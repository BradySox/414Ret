# 414th — COIN line HANDOFF (next-session pickup)

**Written 2026-07-02** at the end of the session that built the whole line. Start here;
the specs of record are `414th-coin-insurgent-replenishment-notes.md` (the model) and
`414th-coin-reinfiltration-notes.md` (the C1.5 design). Will-profile machinery:
`414th-will-generalization-notes.md`.

## Where the line stands (all merged to main 2026-07-02)

| Slice | PR | State |
|---|---|---|
| Will profiles + warship feed (the enabler) | #417 | ✅ merged |
| C1 — regen core (`game/fourteenth/coin.py`) | #419 | ✅ merged |
| C1.5 — re-infiltration **design** | #421 | ✅ merged (design only) |
| C2 — `red_cache_lost` will feed | #423 | ✅ merged |
| C3 — **Operation Enduring Resolve (COIN)** campaign + the TGO revival channel | #424 | ✅ merged |
| **P1 in-game pass** | — | ☐ **THE NEXT STEP** (checklist P1) |
| C4 — dispersed harassment cells (§20 placement machinery) | — | design-only, optional texture |
| C1.5 — re-infiltration **build** | — | slotted **after P1 tuning** |

## The next step is a cockpit, not a keyboard

Everything headless is done and CI-locked (engine probe verified regen/revival, the
cache throttle to the 0.25 floor, profile + arc resolution on the real campaign;
1407 tests green). **Fly checklist P1**: new campaign *"Afghanistan - Operation
Enduring Resolve (COIN)"*, 5+ turns. The experiment that proves the loop:

1. Strike one stronghold's **cells** without touching its caches → recon it 2 turns
   later → the cells are back (and the map lied to you until the recon — that's
   `alive_at_last_recon` working, not a bug).
2. Kill both its **caches** → the same stronghold stops refilling (floor trickle).
3. Watch the will message: mandate vs momentum, cache kills as labeled
   "ammo caches xN destroyed" movers. The **will ledger** (meter hover / SITREP
   movers) is the tuning instrument.

## The tuning levers (in expected order of need)

- **Pace of the insurgency**: `REGEN_BASE_UNITS_PER_TURN` (2.0) and
  `CACHE_HEALTH_FLOOR` (0.25) in `game/fourteenth/coin.py`.
- **The will economy**: the campaign's own `will: weights:` block in
  `resources/campaigns/coin_enduring_resolve.yaml` — no code change. Current COIN
  inversion: `red_cache_lost` 4.0, `red_ground_unit_lost` 0.05,
  `blue_passive_regen` 0.0, `blue_roe_violation` 6.0, bases 5.0 both sides.
- **Cache density**: the laydown table in `tools/build_coin_enduring_resolve_miz.py`
  (re-run it; **never hand-edit the miz**).
- **Arc pacing**: `phases:` min_turns (10/20) + `advance_when` thresholds (45/25).

## Gotchas discovered building it (don't relearn these)

- **This laydown has NO front lines** ⇒ `Base.armor` is empty everywhere; the
  insurgent force lives in the vehicle-group TGOs. That's why `coin.py` has TWO
  channels (garrison commission, then **TGO revival** toward `tgo_cap`). Any future
  COIN laydown with real ground routes exercises the garrison channel instead.
- The insurgent **technicals are class IFV** in the unit data — the whitelist is
  class set + **price ≤ 10**; the ceiling (not the class) is what excludes BMPs/Grads.
- **Bost/Herat never instantiate as CPs** (neutral fields) — the population-center
  ROE rings are **coordinate-anchored** (`x:`/`y:`), not `center:`-named.
- Never `locked_targets: [ammo]` in the arc — the caches must always be legal.
- **Toyota Al Gaib 2001 was missing most of the insurgent kit** (user catch 2026-07-02,
  fixed): the DIM' technicals, the §41 ERO ZU-23 family + preset group, and the SA-9
  now match the sibling insurgent factions (still no armor by design). The campaign
  preseeds `high_digit_sams` so the ERO units resolve.
- The ratline works by preseeding `vietnam_convoy_interdiction` directly (the module
  is coalition-generic inside); the "widen the gate to honor `coin_insurgency`"
  refactor from the note §3.3 was **not needed** and remains undone by choice.

## After P1

- **Tune** from ledger data (levers above), update the P1 row status.
- **C1.5 build** (re-infiltration): spec is complete in its note; 4 open squadron
  calls in its §8 (hold threshold, 2+2 timers, one-attempt cap, neutral scope) —
  answer them from P1 feel, then build against real geometry.
- **C4** (dispersed cells via `place_unit_group`): optional texture; only if the
  played campaign feels too static between stronghold fights.
